    "Raster maps representing age and sex structures can be obtained from [WorldPop Hub](https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/listing?id=138). These maps have a **100 m spatial resolution** and are available for the years **2015 to 2030**. It is recommended to download a map corresponding to a year is which a **national population survey**, so that the validity of the raster data can be assessed.\n",

    "A .zip file will be downloaded. When opended, it contains raster maps for **males (m), females (f)** and the **total population (t)**, each divided into the age groups: 00, 01, 05, 10, and so on, up to 90, in five years intervals."

From the *Select Landast* drop down menu, choose **Landsat 8** and then from the *Select Emissivity* menu, select **MODIS**. Use the **Draw Polygon** tool to delineate your study area. Alternatively, you can upload a .KML file, using the *Load KML* option; however, this feature may not always work properly, so the first option is recommended.\n",
